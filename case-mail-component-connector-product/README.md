# Case Mail Component Connector

A simple mail component designed to send and receive emails related to a specific Ivy case. All sent emails are automatically linked to their corresponding case, providing seamless tracking and management of communication within the workflow.

The Case Mail Component Connector allows sending, receiving, replying, forwarding, and resending emails linked to an Ivy case.
- A email list view displays key details like date, sender, recipient, and subject.
- Detailed email views and process integration ensure seamless communication tracking.
- It supports field validation, error handling with retry logic, and admin task management for failed emails.
- Original message content and attachments are preserved in replies, forwards, and resends.

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry mechanism:
  - Retries `x` times every `y` seconds, configurable via variable:
    - `mailLoopRepeatNumber`
    - `mailLoopRepeatDelay`
- If all retries fail, an admin task is created.

### Admin Tasks
- **Abort:** Cancels the task and ends the process.
- **Retry:** Attempts to send the email again.
If it fails, retries based on the configured retry logic and generates another admin task if needed.

### Received Mail
Retrieves all mails from the mailbox whose subject matches the pattern defined in the `subjectMatches` variable.

If the mail contains a valid case reference in the subject (as defined in the `caseReferenceRegex` variable), it is moved to the `processedFolderName` folder; otherwise, it is moved to the `errorFolderName` folder.

After the email is processed, a task is created for user with Role defined in the `retrieveMailTaskRole` variable.

## Setup
1. Configure Maximum Request Body Size

   Set the maximum size (in bytes) of the request body that the server should buffer/save during:
   - FORM or CLIENT-CERT authentication
   - HTTP/1.1 upgrade requests

   **How to configure:**
   - In `ivy.yaml`:  
     ```yaml
     Http:
       MaxPostSize: 2097152
     ```  
     ðŸ‘‰ Reference: [Axon Ivy Docs â€“ ivy.yaml](https://developer.axonivy.com/doc/12.0/engine-guide/configuration/files/ivy-yaml.html)

   - In **nginx** configuration:  
     ```nginx
     client_max_body_size 150M;
     ```

2. Set the following variables in your project:
```
@variables.yaml@
```

3. Set up folders in your mailbox

	If you are using the received mail feature, create two folders in your mailbox as configured in the `processedFolderName` and `errorFolderName` variables
