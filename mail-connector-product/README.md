# Mail connector

A simple mail component designed to send and receive emails related to a specific Ivy case. All sent emails are automatically linked to their corresponding case, providing seamless tracking and management of communication within the workflow.

The Mail Connector allows sending, receiving, replying, forwarding, and resending emails linked to an Ivy case.
- A mail list view displays key details like date, sender, recipient, and subject.
- Detailed mail views and process integration ensure seamless communication tracking.
- It supports field validation, error handling with retry logic, and admin task management for failed mails.
- Original message content and attachments are preserved in replies, forwards, and resends.

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry mechanism:
  - Retries `x` times every `y` seconds, configurable via variable:
    - `mailLoopRepeatNumber`
    - `mailLoopRepeatDelay`
- If all retries fail, an admin task is created.

### Admin Tasks
- **Abort:** Cancels the task and ends the process.
- **Retry:** Attempts to send the email again.
If it fails, retries based on the configured retry logic and generates another admin task if needed.
